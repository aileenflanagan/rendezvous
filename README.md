After clicking signup, the website will take you to the search for groups page! Here, you can start searching for groups by typing in the search box what kind of groups you would like to find i.e. writing, excercising, dogs, etc. If nothing appeals, you can also create your own group by clicking the create my group button.

If you decided to create your own group, the website will take you to the create groups page. Here, you can add in your group name, what the group is about, and a picture representing your group. For example, if your group is all about pirates, inserting a picture of a pirate flag probsbly won't be the best solution. Instead, insert a picture of what the group does as in reading pirate books, acting out pirate scenes, doing scavenger hunts outside, etc. That way, members looking for a group will see first hand if they want to be in the next picture since it appeals to them!

Once your group is created, the website will take you to your group home page where you will be able to tell your group members where you would like to meet, if they need to bring anything, and add in special events. Special events can be meeting locations, incentives for completing group goals i.e. hosting a movie night based on the book your book group has been reading, or to inform your group about events your local city may be hosting based on your group's activity.

If you need to change anything about your group, click the settings button and it will take you to your account settings page. Here, you will be able to delete members if you created the group, change the name of the group, or delete the group entirely as well as editing location, events, the group picture, etc. In the settings page, you are also able to leave groups that you have joined. You will also be able to add a profile picture for all rendenvouz to see once you create or join groups!
